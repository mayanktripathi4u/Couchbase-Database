# 🚀 Learning Couchbase Database
Welcome to my Couchbase learning repository! This repo is a concepts & hands-on journey as I explore and understand the powerful NoSQL database system — Couchbase.

**Started on: June 22, 2025**

Today, I’m starting my journey to learn and explore **Couchbase Database** — a powerful, modern NoSQL database system. This repository will serve as my personal learning log, helping me stay organized and consistent. It’s also a great way to document and share my progress with friends, colleagues, and the developer community.

Feel free to follow along, contribute, or use it as a starting point for your own Couchbase learning adventure!

Couchbase is a NoSQL database, designed primarily for high performance, scalability, and flexibility — especially useful for modern applications like mobile apps, real-time analytics, and web platforms.
