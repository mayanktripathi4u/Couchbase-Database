# 🚀 Learning Couchbase Database
Welcome to my Couchbase learning repository! This repo is a concepts & hands-on journey as I explore and understand the powerful NoSQL database system — Couchbase.

**Started on: June 22, 2025**

Today, I’m starting my journey to learn and explore **Couchbase Database** — a powerful, modern NoSQL database system. This repository will serve as my personal learning log, helping me stay organized and consistent. It’s also a great way to document and share my progress with friends, colleagues, and the developer community.

Feel free to follow along, contribute, or use it as a starting point for your own Couchbase learning adventure!

Couchbase is a NoSQL database, designed primarily for high performance, scalability, and flexibility — especially useful for modern applications like mobile apps, real-time analytics, and web platforms.

# 📌 What is Couchbase Database?
In layman terms, Couchbase is like a super-fast digital filing cabinet. Instead of putting your documents (data) into fixed folders (tables and columns like in traditional databases), you can drop in flexible documents (called JSON documents) where each can look a bit different. It's like organizing files in a way that doesn't force every file to follow the same template.

Couchbase is like a super-fast, flexible digital cabinet that stores your information as smart files (JSON), easy to change, easy to find, and always ready — whether you're building a mobile app, a game, or a global e-commerce platform. It’s not meant for deep data analysis but is perfect for real-time operations.

# 📌 Why is it used?
Couchbase is used when:

* You need real-time performance (e.g., gaming, e-commerce, mobile apps).

* Your data structure is changing often or is unstructured.

* You want to scale easily (e.g., millions of users worldwide).

* You need offline + online sync (especially for mobile apps).

* You need high availability and replication across servers or geographies.

## 📌 Why Couchbase?

Couchbase is a modern, distributed NoSQL database optimized for high performance, scalability, and flexibility. It supports flexible JSON documents, SQL-like querying (N1QL), built-in caching, and real-time mobile sync — making it ideal for modern apps.


# 🔹 How is it different from other databases?
If you have every worked in any other databases, then you might have this question, how Couchbase database is different from that specific database I have worked or working.

|Feature|	Couchbase|	Traditional RDBMS (e.g., MySQL)	|MongoDB (another NoSQL DB)|
|--|--|--|--|
|Type	|NoSQL (Document Store + Key-Value)	|Relational (SQL-based)|	NoSQL (Document Store)|
|Schema|	Flexible (schema-less)	|Rigid (pre-defined schema)	|Flexible|
|Performance	|Very high (built-in cache)	|Moderate	|High|
|Scaling	|Horizontally scalable	|Hard to scale |horizontally	Scalable|
|Query Language	|N1QL (SQL-like for JSON)	|SQL	|Mongo Query Language
|Built-in Cache	|Yes (key differentiator)	|No	|No
|Mobile Sync	|Yes (Couchbase Mobile)	|No	|Some support


# 🔹 Is Couchbase OLTP or OLAP?
✅ OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) — Couchbase is best used for fast, frequent read/write operations like in:

* User profiles

* Shopping carts

* Real-time data sync

* Mobile app data

> 🚫 Not designed primarily for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) or deep analytical queries. You’d typically use a separate system for that, like a data warehouse.

> ✅ Database → Yes, Couchbase is a NoSQL operational database.

> ❌ Data Warehouse → No, it's not built for large-scale batch analytics or BI dashboards.

> ❌ Data Lake → No, it doesn't store unstructured raw data in massive volume like Hadoop or S3.
